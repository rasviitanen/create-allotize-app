## create-allotize-app

This app is a simple demonstration on how to use Allotize in your own project.
Note that Allotize is not yet stable enough to be used in production.

Install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Run the application:

```
yarn start
```

Visit the application at `localhost:8080`.
The application runs a markdown document that everyone connected to your page
are able to collaborate on.
Try it out by opening multiple pages, either on separate devices or with
just additional tabs.

Happy coding!

## About Allotize

Allotize is an attempt of building a data management pattern very much like Vuex/Redux, but where we are also able to share data/state/information with remote machines.
The project is essentially composed of two major modules, a database and a P2P networking solution.
