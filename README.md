## create-hadal-app
This app is a simple demonstration on how to use Hadal in your own project.
Note that Hadal is not yet stable enough to be used in production.

Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the application:
```
npm run start
```

Visit the application at `localhost:8080`.
The application runs a markdown document that everyone connected to your page
are able to collaborate on.
Try it out by opening multiple pages, either on separate devices or with
just additional tabs.

Happy coding!

## About Hadal
Hadal is an attempt of building a data management pattern very much like Vuex/Redux, but where we are also able to share data/state/information with remote machines.
The project is essentially composed of two major modules, a database and a P2P networking solution.
